This is my first Laravel practice project.
It was created in two weeks for a programming school, so there are still many bugs remaining.
However, if I have time, I will fix them later.

I learned that I need to think more about objects and simplify the code.
Also, I should have planned better because I changed the database structure many times during development, which made the work more complicated.
